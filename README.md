### About

Due to a nation-wide lockdown, your local pub is no longer able to run their weekly quiz night onsite. Your local pub owners know you are an IT student \& ask if you want create an online quiz night application for them. For the first step, the pub owners want a **RESTful API** that provides various functions for registering, logging in, participating in various quizzes \& keeping track of scores so that they can give away prizes at the end of each quiz night.

### Objectives

- Apply design patterns & programming principles using software development best practices.
- implement full-stack applications using industry relevant programming languages.

## Local Configuration

Navigate to the projects root after cloning

```shell
cd assessment-1-node-js-restful-api-AardhynLavender
```

Install dependencies

```shell
npm i
```

Set up your `.env` file with

```shell
./configureEnvironment
```

or manually with

```
cp template.env .env
vim .env
```

You'll need configure the variables outlined in the template

| Variable            | Description                                                                    |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PORT                | Port to listen on                                                              |
| SHADOW_DATABASE_URL | See `Prisma > Environment`                                                     |
| DATABASE_URL        | See `Prisma > Environment`                                                     |
| SESSION_LIFETIME    | How long your users are logged in for, measured in hours. Use a natural number |
| SEED_GIST_HASH      | See `Seeding > API`                                                            |
| GITHUB_USERNAME     | See `Seeding > API`                                                            |
| IMPLICIT_SEEDING    | Specify if the program should seed constants from **Open Trivia DB**           |
| NODE_ENV            | Where is Node?... I like to be specific                                        |

## Prisma Configuration

### Entity Relationship Diagram

For reference, here's an ERD of the current database

> Generated by the wonderful [SqlDBM](https://sqldbm.com/Home/) from Prisma's migration script.

### Environment

Firstly, you need to setup a database. I use a PostgreSQL instance on a Heroku free tier ( at least, for now... ).

Create a `new app`, and add **two** `Heroku Postgres` addons -- the free ones will do.

You'll need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` and `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` in your local environment.

> You'll find these in your `Config Vars` section in the settings for your Heroku app. Use the `HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_*******` variable for your `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL`.

### Migrations

Changes to the `prisma.schema` file will require running a migration to take effect.

Format the prisma schema with `prisma:format`, this will align the columns within models so they are easier to read.

Run `prisma:migrate` to create the `sql` commands needed to apply your changes.

> You will lose data in this process, have a look at [this article](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/migrate-development-production#production-and-testing-environments) for production viable migrations.

Now that your changes have been applied, we need to update our ORM and TypeScript definitions, so our client in in sync with our database. Run `prisma:generate` for this.

> Note, you may need to restart your TypeScript language server to get the updated definitions. i.e: For Visual Studio Code, run `>TypeScript: Restart TS server` in your command palette.

#### TL;DR

If your in a hurry, you can run `prisma:omni` to invoke all 3 scripts in one.

### Studio

Prisma has a useful CRUD Application that runs in your browser. Great for visualizing your models, relationships, and performing quick modifications and deletions.

After you've run your a migration, check it out with the `prisma:studio` script.

### Seeding

If you want to seed collections, add a file to a Github Gist, and specify the filename as a seed pool in the `seed` section of a `Crud Interface`. You can choose what roles are able to access the seed route too.

#### API

You can seed data into the database via API request. optionally specifying the `pool` to seed from.

From `User`:

```typescript
  seed: [
    {
      unconditionalAccess: ["SUPER_USER"],
      pool: "admin",
    },
    {
      unconditionalAccess: ["SUPER_USER", "ADMIN_USER"],
      pool: "basic",
    },
  ],
```

Seed using

```
/<table>/seed/[:pool]
```

You will need to set the hash as your `SEED_GIST_HASH` and the username as the `GITHUB_USERNAME` for the seeding to work. Otherwise, and exception will be thrown.

For convince, you can use my own Gist with the following variables

```shell
SEED_GIST_HASH=271fbf9f9d9ecd5bba6da1234eff1f79
GITHUB_USERNAME=aardhynlavender
```

- use `/users/seed/admin` to seed `ADMIN_USERS`.
- use `/users/seed/basic` to seed 'BASIC_USERS`.

Of course, this route is only accessible to `SUPER_USER` sessions...

#### Super Users

As `SUPER_USER`s are quite powerful, you can only seed them manually from the command line.

Use the `create_seeds` script and specify a `number` of users to create.

```shell
cd ./seeding
./create_seeds.sh 3
```

This will create the templates you need to create some super user seeds.

Use the `seed:super_users` npm script to load them into your database.

#### Implicit Seeding

The `Types`, `Categories`, and `Difficulties` models are checked and, if necessary, repopulated each time you run your API.

You can all so run this manually, by using the `seed:implicit` script, and setting `IMPLICIT_SEEDING` to `false`.

> Note, If you get any `foreign key constraint` errors on any of the aforementioned tables, running this script should resolve any dangling pointers.

## Code Linting

My codebase uses **ESLint** for linting, run `lint:check` for a a summary of errors and warnings, and run `lint:fix` to resolve them ( I do not advice this ).

## Coding Standard

### Prettier

**Prettier** makes my code look pretty! and it can make your additions look the same too!

For IDE's and fancy Text Editors I'd advice configuring some sort of "format on save" feature. but for you 'command line crusaders', run `prettier:check` to show any formatting problems. `prettier:write` will apply the rules, although this run automatically when you commit staged files.

## Integration Testing

Run `qa:test` to run my integrated test suite.

As this will delete **all data currently in the database**, please be careful -- I'd recommend setting up a testing database for local development.

## Code Coverage

For more in-depth testing, use `qa:coverage` to run the test suite with a summative code coverage report at the end. This script will output an `html` report to the `./coverage` directory -- open `index.html` to view the report if it does not open automatically at the end.

## Deployment

### Live Deployment

You can use the API right now by visiting [this site](https://laveat1-quiz-api.herokuapp.com/), or using the following url

```plaintext
https://laveat1-quiz-api.herokuapp.com/
```

### Custom Deployment ( Heroku )

Create your own deployment on Heroku by `fork`ing this repository on GitHub.

Create a `new app`, following the standard prompts.

Once created, head over to `Settings > Config Vars`, and add all the environment variables ( you _can_ leave out `NODE_ENV` ).

Under `Deploy > Deployment Method` use the `GitHub` option, and enter the name of your forked repository. ( if you have not already setup Heroku with GitHub, there may be some extra steps to getting this link working ).

Enable automatic deploys, and open your app.

> Note, if your using a new Database for this deployed app, you will need to load it locally, and run a migration on it.
